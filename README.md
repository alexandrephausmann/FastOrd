# FastOrd
FastOrder it's an order management system, developed to organize the orders of a restaurant, with the possibility to
integrate with external systems on time real.
It's a personal study project just to improve the angular knowledge and English language, the system can have
responsivity problems and can be not so user friendly.

(I started the C# code in portuguese, but the objective it's take off all of these portuguese for the project, it's on progress)

## ðŸš€ Technology idea

The idea it was improve my personal skills and mix that in one entire system. To make the third systems integration, my idea
was use RabbitMQ.

<h2>Tools</h2>
<ul>
	<li>C#(.net 5.0)</li>
	<li>Entity framework</li>
	<li>RabbitMQ</li>
	<li>SQL</li>
	<li>Angular</li>
	<li>Material UI</li>
</ul>

Future tecnologies maybe:

- Docker
